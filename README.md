## üëã Hey everyone, I'm Marius

### Some fun facts about me:
I'm tall, and I can't help myself with cakes.
Proud of my merged African/French legacy. 
I'm here because I'm curious, and if you are here too, I guess that's something we have in common.
I love video games, mainly because I consider them as one of the top opportunities to mix art and engineering.

### My favorite topics:
- Competitive programming
- Automation
- Distributed Systems (Chaos vs. Order)

### GitHub Stats:

### Watch my contribution graph get eaten by the snake üêç
I created this account in 2014. Since then, I have mostly been using Bitbucket and Gitlab. Back in 2022 I decided 
to put more effort into Github contributions.
<!-- platane/snk works, it just puts it on a new branch -->
